# Educational Interactive-Intelligent Platform

### Introduction
Our project focuses on addressing a common challenge faced by elementary students when they encounter math word problems. We recognize that these problems often involve complex language and abstract concepts, making them difficult to comprehend and solve. To overcome this, our team has developed a solution that utilizes generated images to provide visual support to students, helping them better understand the problems and boosting their confidence in solving them.

In recent years, there has been a growing demand for innovative educational tools and approaches that can help children understand mathematical concepts and problems more easily. One such approach is the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to illustrate mathematical concepts.
